              <p>Hello! I'm Bryan, an aspiring software engineer currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in Engineering. My journey in tech started with a 
                humble curiosity about how things work and rapidly transformed into a passion for creating, problem-solving, and continuous learning.</p>
            <p>My experience to date has provided me a solid foundation in programming, with a particular interest in programming and robotics. 
                I'm always looking for new challenges that can push my boundaries and help me grow as an engineer.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding or tinkering with my latest robotics project, you might find me exploring new music, playing a video game, or immersed in literature.</p>
            <p>I believe that technology, when used with intention, has the power to transform lives and societies for the better. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects and innovate solutions that make a difference. 
                Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!</p>
